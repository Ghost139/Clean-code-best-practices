# Clean-code-principles
- Meaningful Names
    - Pick one word per concept
    - Use solution domain Names
    - Use problem Domain Names
- Functions
    - Must be small
    - Should do only one thing
        - A way to know a function is doing more than one thing is if you can extract another function from it with a name that is not merely a restatement o its implementation
        - The statements within our function are all at the same level of abstraction 
    - Should have one level or two level of abstractions(indentations) 
    - Ideally should have zero arguments or just one
    - Should have no side effect
    - Should respect Command Query Separation
    - Return exceptions instead of error codes
- Comments
- Formatting
- Objects and Data Structures
- Error Handling
- TDD
    - Must respect three laws
        - You may not write production code until you have a written a failing unit test
        - You may not write more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail, and not compilling is failing
        - You may not write more production code than is sufficient to pass the currently failing test
